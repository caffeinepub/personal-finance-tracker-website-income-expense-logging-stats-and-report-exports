  "summary": "Diff appears to address the Transaction form currency UX (including a CUSTOM currency state and custom currency fields) and adjusts transaction CRUD hooks to call backend methods with a TransactionData object. Due to truncation of key sections (form submit logic, UI rendering of Custom option/exchange rate/preview, and backend updateTransaction signature details), several acceptance-criteria aspects cannot be conclusively verified from the provided diff excerpt.",
